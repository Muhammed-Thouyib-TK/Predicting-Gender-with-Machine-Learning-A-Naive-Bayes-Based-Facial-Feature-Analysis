# 👥 Predicting Gender with Machine Learning: A Naive Bayes-Based Facial Feature Analysis

A clean, interpretable, and efficient approach to gender classification using facial features and the Naive Bayes algorithm — demonstrating the power of probabilistic learning in a real-world binary classification task.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to predict an individual's gender using various **facial and physical attributes** such as hair length, nose shape, forehead width, and more. By applying a **Gaussian Naive Bayes** classifier to structured binary and numerical features, this case study showcases how even a simple model can yield high performance when combined with proper **data preprocessing**, **EDA**, and **model evaluation**.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand and clean a structured facial feature dataset
- Visualize data to identify trends and class separability
- Apply Naive Bayes classification for gender prediction
- Evaluate model effectiveness and interpret results

---

## 🗂️ Dataset

The dataset includes structured data with:

- Binary Features: e.g., `Hair_Length` (Short/Long), `Nose_Shape` (Pointed/Round)  
- Continuous Features: e.g., `Forehead_Width`, `Eye_Size`, `Jaw_Angle`  
- 🎯 Target Variable: `Gender` (0 = Female, 1 = Male)

> Source: Public facial structure datasets (or hypothetical data for academic demonstration)
